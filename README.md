Go REST Hooks

## Background

I've been doing systems integrations for a long time.  But I've never had the budget to leverage fancy ESB's
or message queues.  And depending on your perspective, that may be a good thing.

It's no secret that the cloud is transforming (no integrations pun intended) how we do things.  So I've been 
thinking about how I might leverage the cloud to make my integration tasks easier, more scalable and fault
tolerant.

A few weeks ago I stumbled upon this blog [post](https://zapier.com/engineering/introducing-resthooksorg/) about [REST Hooks](http://resthooks.org/).
